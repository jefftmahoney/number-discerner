# Number Discerner

This repo is a simple example of how to build a number discerner using [BrainJS](https://brain.js.org/#/).

It features a neural network that takes, as an input, a number (expected to be between 0 and 9) drawn by users on a grid in an HTML form, and returns its best guess as to what that number is.
